# Voxel Rendering Project
## University final year dissertation project.

Voxel planet rendering tool.

This tools allows the creation of large-scale voxel planets, including terrain and cave noise settings. A secondary part of the project includes a first-person controller script which allows you to update the terrain of the planets in realtime.

This project utilises the Marching Cubes algorithm, using compute shaders.
